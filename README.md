# urql-custom-scalars-exchange

urql exchange to allow mapping of custom scalar types

## Example

```sh
yarn add urql-custom-scalars-exchange
```

or

```
npm install --save urql-custom-scalars-exchange
```

Define a custom scalar like `Json` in your schema via:

```gql
scalar Json
```

Download the introspection query from your endpoint. See the [urql docs](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/graphcache/schema-awareness/#getting-your-schema) for a script to download the schema from your endpoint.

Configure the exchange like so

```js
import customScalarsExchange from 'urql-custom-scalars-exchange';
import schema from '../schema.json';

const scalarsExchange = customScalarsExchange({
    schema: schema,
    scalars: {
        Json(value) {
            return JSON.parse(value);
        },
    },
});
```

Finally add the exchange to your urql client like so

```js
const client = createClient({
    url: 'http://localhost:1234/graphql',
    exchanges: [dedupExchange, scalarsExchange, fetchExchange],
});
```

## FAQ

### Should this exchange be listed before or after the cache exchange?

This exchange should be listed before any cache exchange. Cache exchanges
should represent the the data as returned by the endpoint.
